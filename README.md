# CryptoSort

 CryptoSort is a cryptocurrency price tracking application written in Android Java. You can search, sort (by price or alphabetical order) or add cryptocurrencies to your favorites after login your account.
 
 App gets cryptocurrency info from API and shows it async in recyclerview. Cryptocurrencies that you added to your favorites doesn't get wiped after restarting app because of favorite status database. 
 
> I have developed this application for Java course final term project.

> UPDATE: Favorites no longer stays in only local memory. Added Firebase realtime database for favorite currencies so you can track your currencies on every device.
